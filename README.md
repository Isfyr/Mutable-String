# Mutable-String
In this lab, you'll write a Text class that provides something Python doesn't have natively: a mutable string type.

This is also a look into how standard Python types are designed. The interface for the Text class will be very similar to the interface for Python's built-in list type, and you'll also implement some "magic" functions that enable your Text class to work with Python features (like square brackets and for loops) the same way that built-in classes do.
